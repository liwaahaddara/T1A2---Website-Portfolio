# Liwaa's Portfolio Website

## **Overview**

This is an introductory website for myself.  
It's meant to provide potential employers and any site visitors in general my foundational knowledge in creating a website about myself.  
It'll also help to get my feet in the water to become more familiarized with creating any website in general by following certain structures, aligning components in a certain manner, etc

### **Decision Making Process**

- I had looked at a few online porfolio templates and decided to emulate the design of a particular one.
- The goal was to create 4 pages initially, specifically (in the following order):
  - The Home Page
  - The Portfolio Page
  - The About Me Page
  - The Contact Me Page
- Then I conveniently remembered that a crucial part of the website would be the blog part
- I then decided to add a 5th page, namely the Blog page (with sub pages within it for each respective blog post)
- Finally decided to merge the about me and contact me section into one page, and was left with a total fo 4 pages (in the following order):
  - Home
  - Portfolio
  - Blog
  - About Me/Contact Me

### **Challenges Faced**

- Struggled with being able to create media queries, as I wasn't sure how many versions of each page I need to create and because I wasn't sure of the appropriate thresholds to place (in terms of cuttoff points, such as 600px wide or 900px wide)
- Slowly started to understand how to make the layout responsive by implementing flexbox (still need to properly learn CSS grid)
